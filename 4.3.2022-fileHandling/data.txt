In this tutorial, you will learn about the stack data structure and its implementation in Python, Java and C/C++.
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.
You can think of the stack data structure as the pile of plates on top of another.
